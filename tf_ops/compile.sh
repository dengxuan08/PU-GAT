## please be patient whn complie tf_ops. This is the hardest part in reproducing our results.

# Using different system may require different code for compiling. But is is not always correct.
# Try both to compile.
# If both of them does not work, make sure tf_lib, tf_inc, cuda_lib all correct and $nvcc is the same version as CUDA


# eg. Below is the env I used for the remote cluster
#module load cuda/10.0.130 # uncomment this line if not using the remote cluster

# If below does not work, you can try to set system='linux'
system='linux' # linux or centos.
    #  usually set to linux, if does not work, try change to centos.
    #  difference is we comment -D_GLIBCXX_USE_CXX11_ABI=0 out in centos
